\chapter{Search for compressed Higgsinos with soft lepton tracks}

In this chapter, the search for compressed Higgsinos with soft lepton tracks is presented.
First, the model considered in this search is introduced and motivated, followed by description of previous searches done for such signature. The search strategy is then described in a general way in order to gain an overview of the analysis. Later, the data sets and simulated samples that were used are listed. The main description of the analysis starts with an exploration of the signal signature and base selection, followed by the object definition and selection, and then by the event selection and trigger used. Background sources are then identified, and the procedures used to estimate them are described in detail in the section that follows. Data control plots show simulation to data comparison in control regions, and then the search bins constituting the signal regions are described, alongside the optimization procedure made to define them. Sources of systematic uncertainties are estimated
for the background estimation methods, followed by background validation studies. Data quality aspects are then explored. The chapter concludes with the expected results of full Run 2 luminosity of 137\fbinv, as well as observed results in partial unbinding of 10\% of the data collected during that period by CMS at center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$.

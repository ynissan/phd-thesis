\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to my PhD supervisors Prof. Peter Schleper and Prof. Gudrid Moortgat-Pick for allowing me to work on this PhD, and for the guidance and patience throughout.

I would also like to thank from the bottom of my heart Sam Bein for guiding me through every step of the way and providing valuable input and help. Sam has always been a great partner for discussion about physics and philosophy. If anyone would ever end up finding SUSY at CMS it would definitely be him.

Furthermore, I would like to thanks all the SUSY group of the University of Hamburg, Alexandra Tews, Malte Mrowietz, Moritz Wolf and Viktor Kutzner for endless discussions and nice times.

I would also like to thank my family who waited patiently in Israel for my very sparse visits during the PhD.

Lastly, I want to thank Benjamin the elephant, who has supported me emotionally through very hopeless times.
